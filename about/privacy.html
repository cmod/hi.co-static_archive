		<p>Welcome to Hi.</p>

		<p>This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how Moments Management Corp. and its related companies (“Company”) collect, use and share personal information of users of this website, http://hi.co (the “Site”) and Services (as defined in the <a href="http://hi.co/about/terms/">Terms of Use</a> (where such term includes, without limitation, the Site and mobile applications)).

		<p>Our Services provide you with a platform to access, share, and publish stories and experiences from places around the world in various formats subject to the Terms of Use and this Policy.  You understand and agree that your User Content is made public, and may be accessed and viewed by other registered and unregistered users of the Services.  This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Services, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. </p>

For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of user content was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including tags or topic markers (e.g., to provide general context for your moment), “thanks” or “tell me more” actions, local weather information, comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. </li>

For example, facebook may share your friend list with us, in order to help us establish your account and find other Services users that you know. You understand that by granting us access to your social networking service account as part of the functionality of the Services, we will have access to your content, including personally identifiable information, at such social networking service account, and we may access, make available, use and store such content so it is available via your Services account.

		<h4>INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES</h4>

		<p>You may send requests about personal information to our Contact Information below. You can request to change contact choices, opt-out of our sharing with others, and update your personal information.</p>

		<p>You can typically remove and reject cookies from our Site with your browser settings. Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings. If you remove or reject our cookies, it could affect how our Site works for you.</p>

		<h4>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

		<p>We take steps to help protect personal information, such as using secure socket layer technology (SSL) encryption for your transmission of sensitive information. No company can fully prevent security risks, however.  Mistakes may happen. Bad actors may defeat even the best safeguards. </p>

Location is added by enabling your computer or mobile device to provide this information. We may use various technologies to determine location, such as GPS, Wi-Fi or other network-based data such as IP address. Your GPS geo-location is not accessed without your consent. We may use and store your location data to provide location related Services and advertisements.</p>

		<p>However, you may view Hi without sharing your location publicly with other users. If you choose not to post content and share your location with other users, we may still use your location to customize your experience, including but not limited to showing you content and advertisements based on your current or past locations. </p>
