What is Hitotoki?\
\
    http://hitotoki.org\
\
    Hitotoki is a Japanese word derived from hito ("single") and toki (time).\
    Hito is also a homophone for "person" or "individual."\
\
    Hitotoki is a website of personal, singular experiences, inseparably \
    tied to a specific place.\
\
    It's a project that started in Tokyo in May, 2007 and is expanding \
    to other cities around the world. \
\
    The gist of it is:\
\
	As people travel through the anonymity of cityspace they\
	often develop brief, intimate and intense memories that \
	combine their emotions, experience and sense of place. \
	This often happens spontaneously and in places that are \
	nondescript or easily overlooked during the day-to-day \
	bustle. The end result for each individual is a private, \
	internal map of a city.\
\
    Our goal is to illuminate these personal mappings into a greater\
    whole through short narratives tied to and describing these\
    spatial/emotional relationships. As the number of narratives\
    increases, we hope that the site will become an alternative\
    resource for looking at cities.\
\
\
What do you want from me?\
\
    Your story should be:\
    * 200-500 words long\
    * Focused on a single moment\
    * Tied to a specific place in New York\'d1all five boroughs are fair \
      game\'d1and revealing something about this place\
    * Enjoyable for readers who have or haven\'d5t been to New York\
    * Authored by someone who has visited or currently resides in New York\
\
    Also:\
    * An image to accompany your story (optional but recommended)\
    * You can submit more than one story if you like.\
\
    Your story should not be:\
    * A review of a restaurant or cafe\
    * About a generalized area of the city (i.e., write about the dog run in \
      Tompkins Square Park, not just the East Village)\
    * In excess of 500 words\
    * Already published elsewhere\
\
    To give a generic example:\
\
	Some time ago you sat with a date on a bench near the South \
	Street Seaport, looking out at the East River. Now your memory \
	is jogged whenever you see the seaport lights at night from the \
	window of a subway car passing over the Manhattan Bridge. There \
	are emotions connected with the seaport (ex: fleeting sadness \
	because you were dumped by this person soon after), and there are \
	the events and experience surrounding the connection (ex: walking \
	into the seaport mall just to use the bathroom), and there is the \
	description of the seaport (ex: a suburban mall dropped onto the \
	edge of the river).\
\
    These three points: emotion, event, and place are the main components \
    of any one 'hitotoki.' In the above example the hitotoki is composed of \
    sadness connected via a nervous, evening stroll to use the bathroom at \
    the South Street Seaport.\
\
\
Your image (photo, drawing, etc.) should be (if you have one):\
\
    * Something that expresses the place/moment in your story.\
    * At least 300 pixels wide.\
    * Something you have the rights to use.\
    * We'll take video or sound too!\
    * If you don't have one, don't worry! We'll find one for you.\
\
\
What happens next?\
\
    1. We read your story and decide if it fits the spirit of the site.\
    2. If it does, we email you. If it doesn't we email you anyway.\
    3. We give it a little editorial polish if necessary. We email you \
       for approval of edits.\
    4. We publish it (and email you again).\
\
\
What about my rights, man?\
\
    * You retain the rights to do whatever you want with the story for ever and ever.\
    * We may republish your story in some other format in the future.\
    * If this happens we will contact you for permission. By email.\
