					<p>We found the place by accident. Trying bars at random. </p>

<p>She must have been in her eary 20s. She was not classically pretty. She had a sadness, a kindness, a melancholy. She placed small plates of olives and crackers in front of us at the old man&#8217;s behest and I knew we were being charged just to sit down. She took her place at the other end of the bar next to the only other customer, a youngish, tired looking salaryman with his own whisky bottle and a half-empty glass. I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off her. The old man said something, too quiet for us to hear, and she smiled softly in return. </p>

<p>What is it like to be the daughter (I&#8217;m guessing, the daughter) of an old Japanese man? To be the daughter (yes, definitely his daughter) of the owner of a small jazz bar in Kichijoji?<sup id="fn-ref-1"><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>He seemed kind. The bar had a large cabinet filled with bottles of Suntory and Canadian Club, with tags and names handwritten in kanji. Many regulars, I guess, or many people who splurged one night and never came back. The amplifier on the stereo was one of those vintage valve affairs, and was featured on a poster near the doorway. </p>

<p>How many nights had she sat there, amongst the bottles and the obscure records and the crimson velvet walls? I desperately wanted to talk to her, but my Japanese was limited to <em>&#8220;biiru futatsu kudasai&#8221;</em><sup id="fn-ref-2"><a href="#fn-2">[2]</a></sup> and <em>&#8220;eki wa dochira desu ka&#8221;</em><sup id="fn-ref-3"><a href="#fn-3">[3]</a></sup> – hardly engrossing conversation. I tried to listen to what my friend was saying, tried to look away, while my wandering, drunken mind created its own history. </p>

<p>Her mother had died young, unexpectedly, tragically. She had travelled with her father to New York and Chicago to see where the real jazz was played.<sup id="fn-ref-4"><a href="#fn-4">[4]</a></sup> But his dreams of being a professional musician had been too difficult to follow with his daughter in tow, and he had returned to Tokyo and opened this bar. He hadn&#8217;t wanted to return, and she knew this. That was years ago. Recently she had begun making excuses to help him out at the bar, but the real reason she came was that still, more than anything, she loved to watch him play. </p>

<p>He turned away, switched off the stereo, and collected the double bass that leant against the back wall. He stood poised, his eyes closed tight, his right hand index finger floating and ready to fall on the thick E string, warm and golden in the light.</p>

<p>As he played, she would close her eyes and gently sway to the music. Occasionally, when he played a certain phrase, a certain riff, she would smile, slowly, knowingly, as if the riff contained a personal joke, a message just for her.
</p>

	<li id="fn-1"><span> Kichijoji lies about 15 minutes west of Shinjuku on the Chuo line, just outside the hullabaloo of Tokyo's twenty-three central wards. It's known for Inokashira Park and its art markets and swanboats on weekends, fashionable boutiques and cafes - and some token Showa-era nostalgia in the watering holes and food stalls and shacks huddled together in "Harmonica Alley" (ハモニカ横丁) just in front of the station - a reminder of Kichijoji's humble, boondock origins. <a href="#fn-ref-1">&#8617;</a></span></li>

	<li id="fn-4"><span> In fact, Tokyo is perhaps one of the most dedicated jazz cities in the world, along with New York and Paris. In postwar Japan, long before the advent of chain coffee joints, jazz <em>kissa</em> (cafes) (ジャズ喫茶）spread throughout the country. There you could order a cup of coffee, sit and browse comics, newspapers and magazines, while listening to jazz records on vinyl handpicked by the owner. There is a short history of jazz <em>kissa</em><a href="http://tokyojazzsite.com/archives/37"> here</a>. <a href="#fn-ref-4">&#8617;</a></span></li>
